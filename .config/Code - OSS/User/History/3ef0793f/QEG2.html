    United in a sign of salvation
    <br>
    I raise the emblem of Aryan empire
    <br>
    As the successor of SS
    <br>
    I'll fullfill the will of my Fuhrer
    <br>
    This strife for our victory
    <br>
    My life for our leader
  </p>

  <p>
    I praise this flowing blood
    <br>
    Undivine gift so precious
    <br>
    I hear the chants of agony
    <br>
    On the path to our conquering battles
    <br>
    This strife for our victory
    <br>
    My life for our leader
  </p>
  <p>
    Glory to you soldiers of Germany
    <br>
    I'll never forget your acts
    <br>
    I hail those who died
    <br>
    For the consecration of a New Order
    <br>
    Sieg Heil!
