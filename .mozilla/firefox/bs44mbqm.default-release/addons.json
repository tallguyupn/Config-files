The goal of DeArrow is to make titles accurate and reduce sensationalism.\n\nDeArrow is a paid (if you want) browser extension. You can purchase an unlimited-use license key for 1$. However, if you cannot, or do not want to pay, you can use the extension by clicking the \"I can't/don't want to pay\" button.\n\nTitles can be any arbitrary text. Thumbnails are screenshots from specific timestamps in the video. These are user submitted and voted on.\n\nBy default, if there are no submissions, it will format the original title to the user-specified format, and set a screenshot from a random timestamp as the thumbnail. This can be configured in the options to disable formatting, or show the original thumbnail by default.\n\nIf the original thumbnail is actually good, you can still vote for it in the submission menu, and then it will act like a submission.\n\nNo more dealing with clickbait, arrows, or annoying faces.\n\nUsers can submit better titles and thumbnails for each video and vote on them.\n\nHow does DeArrow differ from Clickbait Remover for YouTube?\n- Unlike Clickbait Remover, DeArrow's main purpose is for crowdsourcing better titles and thumbnails\n\n- When a crowdsourced title is not available, DeArrow will auto-format it according to your setting, but does it in a more sophisticated way than Clickbait Remover. Instead of only setting all words to lower case, or capitalizing every word, DeArrow supports casing systems such as \"Title Case\" and \"Sentence case\". These will still allow acronyms and proper names to remain capitalized.\n\n- When a crowdsourced thumbnail is not available, DeArrow by default shows a screenshot at a random timestamp in the video. Clickbait Remover's thumbnails use YouTube auto-generated thumbnails, and while they are seemingly random, they are chosen by a machine learning algorithm to favor faces with expressions, and other overstimulating features. DeArrow uses truly random timestamps generated by its own server. DeArrow will also check the SponsorBlock database to ensure the randomized thumbnail is not inside of a sponsor segment.\n\n---\n\nSource code: https://github.com/ajayyy/DeArrow\n\nPermissions:\n\nAccess your data for youtube.com, www.youtube-nocookie.com:\n- Used to modify the YouTube webpage\n\nThis add-on may also **ask*\" to access data for any website:\n- You can add your own instances of 3rd party YouTube front-ends, and it will ask for permission to modify each site you add\n- It will never ask for permission for all sites, only the sites you request\n- Invidious support is not finished at the moment","weeklyDownloads":627,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Ajay (SponsorBlock)","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13499177/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/296/296628.png?modified=1710183327","width":1234,"height":1037,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/296/296628.jpg?modified=1710183327","thumbnailWidth":476,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Before and after of four different channels"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/283/283558.png?modified=1710183327","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/283/283558.jpg?modified=1710183327","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Submitting a new title and thumbnail"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/296/296629.png?modified=1710183333","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/296/296629.jpg?modified=1710183333","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Tom Scott's YouTube channel with thumbnails and titles replaced by DeArrow"}],"contributionURL":"https://github.com/sponsors/ajayyy-org?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":3.9524,"reviewCount":135,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dearrow/reviews/","updateDate":1727436672000},{"id":"vimium-c@gdh1995.cn","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/1481/1481317-32.png?modified=5149c4af","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/1481/1481317-64.png?modified=5149c4af","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/1481/1481317-128.png?modified=5149c4af"},"name":"Vimium C - All by Keyboard","version":"1.99.997","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4210117/vimium_c-1.99.997.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c","supportURL":"https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c/issues","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-c/","description":"A keyboard shortcut tool for keyboard-based page navigation and browser tab operations with an advanced omnibar and global shortcuts","fullDescription":"Vimium C is an open source browser extension that provides keyboard-based inner-page navigation, browser tab operations, and an enhanced search panel, so you may take full advantages of your browser without a mouse or touchpad.\n\nIt supports all original commands of Vimium and some new useful commands (a full list can be seen in a help dialog in the Vimium C Options page). And it can map a same key sequence to different commands for different websites (and/or for different active elements in page).\n\nFor example:\n* press `f` to hint all clickable elements of the current web page\n* press `o` to show a search panel (\"Vomnibar\", a safe iframe) to search in your history, bookmarks, opened tabs and configured search engines, and you can even remove a history or tab by selecting a search result and pressing Shift+Delete\n* press j, k, h, l to scroll down/up/left/right on web pages\n* press \"/\" to search for text; press \"v\" to enter Visual Mode (just like VIM)\n* press Shift+J, Shift+K, `g0`, `g$` to switch to the previous/next/first/last tab\n* press `x` to remove a tab, and Shift+X to restore recently closed tabs (sessions), and many other commands\n* command repetition: for example, pressing `5X` (`5`, Shift+X) will restore 5 recent closed tabs\n* configure key mappings to bind Vimium C's tens of commands to other key sequences, and add options to switch command behaviors\n* apply block lists and allow lists of key mappings on configurable special websites and URLs\n\nIt can copy any selected text and current tab's title and URL to the system clipboard, and read the clipboard to search the copied text using a specified search engine.\n\nIt can also enable/disable websites' image loading and even JavaScript execution, if you trigger its command \"toggleCS\". This functionality requires a permission of \"Change your settings that control websites' access to features such as cookies, JavaScript ...\", and Vimium C promises that it won't do any thing secretly, but only act on what key sequences you press.\n\nIt will provide 8 \"global\" browser shortcuts: createTab, previousTab, nextTab, reloadTab, and some others, so you may bind some key sequences to them, and then these commands will work even when a page has no focus (e.g. when the browser address bar is focused).\n\nIt will register an omnibox keyword \"v\", and if you input \"v\" and press Space on the browser address bar (omnibox), you can do searches for history, bookmarks and tabs just like you're inputting on its Vomnibar.\n\nIt supports encoded URLs, and you can search Chinese, Japanese and Korean words in URLs of history and bookmarks. You may configure it to decode URLs in a charset of your locale .\n\nIt will download all synced settings from the Internet during the first installation, and you may enable/disable the syncing on certain computers.\n\nIf you have any exclusion rule for key mappings, it will monitor browser tab URL changes to re-check whether a new URL matches your URL pattern list.\n\nVimium C may show a notification when it gets upgraded to a new minor version.\n\nFor more information about release notes, rebinding your keys and how to use many of Vimium C's features, please see here: https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#readme , or https://gitee.com/gdh1995/vimium-c#git-readme .
